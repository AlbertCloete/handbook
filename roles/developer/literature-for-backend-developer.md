# Literature for Backend developer

To be an awesome backend developer you should know some programming basics (classic programming skills - you can find
them under "Foundations" section) and know/be aware of new trends: modern techniques, tools, APIs, etc. (you can find
them under "Subscriptions" section, please subscribe).

To be an independent developer you should also have some frontend knowledge - you can find frontend materials you need
under "Frontend" section.
