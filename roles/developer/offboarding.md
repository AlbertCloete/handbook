Developer offboarding checklist
===============================

Sometimes it happens... Let's do it in a proper way!

## Checklist
 - Review all pending pull requests (PR) assigned to you as the reviewer.
 - Finish up all your PRs (or reassign them).
 - Reassign GitHub issues to other developers. Update them if you have something to add: more context, current state, etc. The more context you provide - the better.
 - Remove your old/stale branches from GitHub (check that it does not have an associated PR).
 - Remove your contact info from codebase (use fulltext search by your name and nickname).
 - Provide some feedback: we want to become better ðŸ™ƒ!

It's very important that you don't forget these simple steps to help the team stay productive after you've left.

We hope to see you again.
Stay hungry, stay foolish!
