# Literature for Frontend developers

To be an awesome frontend developer you should know some programming basics (classic programming skills - you can find
them under "Foundations" section) and know/be aware about new trends: modern techniques, tools, APIs, etc (you can find
them under "Subscriptions" section).

To be an independent developer you should also have some backend knowledge - you can find backend materials you need
under "Backend" section.

# Backend

## Foundations

1.  [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/master/blade) - PHP template engine. Frontend devs should understand how to
    use `@extend`, `@include`, `@component`, `@section`, `@push`, `@foreach` and `@if` directives. FE devs should also
    understand when they should use `{{ $variable }}` and when `{!! $variable !!}` (display escaped/unescaped data).
1.  How to get an instance of the authenticated Member at the view and determine where the visitor is a guest or not (see
    [Authenticated Member instance](/docs/code/backend/hints/authenticated-member-instance.md)).
1.  You should know how to
    [create a new route and a new test view for it](/docs/code/backend/hints/create-test-route.md) for testing purposes.
    Sometimes this is a faster way to implement a new feature.

For more backend hints please see [backend hints dir](/docs/code/backend/hints).

# Frontend

You can find all the books and videos on the shared folder `IDF - Shared Reading - Library of Development literature and videos`.
_Warning for devs having small SSDs:_ The videos may take more than 10gb on your disk. That's why
you may want to selectively sync those into your computer when you want to study them.
