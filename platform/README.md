About IDF educational platform
==============================

Our educational platform is available by https://www.interaction-design.org address.
It contains few semi-independent parts that we call "Systems".

## Access: members and guests
Our systems have different access levels: some features are members-only, some features are available for all
types of visitors including guests.


## Systems

Tech note:
> Systems are not [microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) and not [modules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming)
but we are on the way to make them more independent from each other.




### Course system
Course system is the heart of our platform: It's our main system to share knowledge. Courses are available to our members.


### Publication system
It's our secondary system to share knowledge. It's available to all visitors. The most important parts of the publication system are:
 - [Articles](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/overview)
 - [Open-source Books](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature)


### Member, Membership, Permission and Payment systems
These systems are responsible from authorization of our members.


### Discussion system
It allows our members to discuss with each other, to communicate with their mentors, and to collaborate inside local groups.


### Local Group system

Our members belong to local communities in their area.
They can organize local meet-ups to build professional network, exchange ideas, and learn from one another.
