Team-trip flows
===============

A team that meets together, stays together.
Remote working does not mean working in isolation â€“ we meet up with the rest of the team several times a year at spectacular locations,
from exotic islands in Thailand to the breathtaking mountains of Patagonia in Argentina.

"Ideas are worthless without execution" - that means we should maximize effect of our team-trips.
