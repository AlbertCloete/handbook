# How to select issues for your backlog

- When choosing issues, you can use "6 ideal work hours per day" as a reference point. An ideal work hour is an hour spent on an issue with a complete focus â€” no interruptions. It makes 60 ideal work hours per sprint.
- Pick all `urgency: high` issues (critical bugs usually).
- Given that, pick first all unfinished "important"(1) issues from the previous sprint.
- Next pick "important"(1) issues selected by ProductOwner as goals for next sprint.
- Finally, pick enough issues to fill your backlog.
- Don't forget to include all critical bugs and urgent priority issues (if any) to the upcoming sprint.

(1) "important" issues are those that add value to our platform; either for our end users or our staff, ProductOwner defines them. We usually mark them by `importantce: high` label.
