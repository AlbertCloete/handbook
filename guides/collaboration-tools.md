# Collaboration tools

Collaboration is a keystone in IDF's success, and we couldn't make it happen without the right tools and processes.
These are the ones we use almost every day.

Please note that you should be using your company email address with all the tools listed below.


### [GitHub](https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation)
Our issue tacker and code storage. Usage of [2FA](https://github.com/settings/security) is required. We also use real face photos for a profile picture to look more friendly to your colleagues.

### [Slack](https://slack.com/download)

We use [Slack](https://slack.com/download) as our main tool for written communication and important notifications.
Unless you're deep in the flow (state), you should be paying attention to what's going on there.

We also use real face photos for a profile picture to look more friendly to your colleagues.

### [Skype](https://go.skype.com/scom.download)

[Skype](https://go.skype.com/scom.download) is our preferred tool to take video calls. Make sure to add the rest of the team to your Skype contacts.
For contact information of your team members, take a look at the file `IDF Onboarding - Team Members Contact Info` in the shared folder `IDF - Staff - Hiring - Onboarding documents and legal templates`.

### [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)

When both Slack (video) and Skype fail, we use [Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) for video calls.

### [Sync](https://www.sync.com/)

We need a secure way of sharing files, and [Sync](https://www.sync.com/) is one of the best tools out there for this purpose.
They make it easy to store, share and access our files from anywhere, and it's free!
Via Sync you will get access to our literature library, exported designs and pretty much any other file you need to do your work.

When you see the phrase "shared folders", we mean the "shared folders" on Sync.

### [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/)

We use [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io) to share designs and assets between designers and developers.
It makes life easier for both parties as all details such as spacing, font size, colors, etc. are listed directly on the designs.
Create an account and let your onboarding buddy know so that they can add you to the project.

### [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com)

We use LastPass to share login credentials, API keys and some top secret information. :-)
Please head to [here](credentials.md) to know how.

### Ye Olde Email

Yeah, we still use email (and pigeons) from time to time.
To make email less dull, we ask new team members to upload their most handsome/beautiful picture with a big smile!

Also, please ensure that you have easy access to check your company email inbox (consider to install a browser extension (
[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notifier-for-gmail/dcjichoefijpinlfnjghokpkojhlhkgl?hl=en),
[Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/gmail-notifier-restartless/),
[Safari](https://safari-extensions.apple.com/details/?id=com.add0n.simple-notifier-RED8XKG2R4)
) or use mail client).
