# Expectations from Developers

We are a small team of senior developers and the IDF does not employ junior or medium level developers. That's why this list only includes our expectations for senior developers.

# Senior developer

1.  A senior developer understands and is aligned with the IDF Company Culture which is _very briefly_ [explained here](/company/README.md) and **very** thoroughly explained in our "IDF Company Culture Course" (taken during your onboarding phase).
1.  A senior developer has printed out the [IDF Zen Code](/README.md#the-idf-zen-code) and regularly re-reads it. Most importantly, he/she reminds the rest of the team when we are not actively **acting** by our own principles defined in the Zen Code. They must never become "pretty words". We must always correlate our actions with our words.
1.  **Seriousness firstly means "responsibility"**. Responsibility for your decisions, solutions, code,
    and communication with the team.
1.  A senior developer is [able to carry a message to Garcia](http://www.actonfoundation.org/pdf/messagetogarcia.pdf):
    They **can take the initiative** when carrying out a difficult assignment.
1.  A senior developer **has experience**; because they are able to learn from their mistakes.
1.  A senior developer **helps their team get better every day**. E.g. by energizing his/her colleagues on group calls, setting an example of awesome code that awes the rest of the team, inspiring colleagues with his/her results/help, etc. etc.
1.  A senior developer **finds and fixes the root causes of the problem** and not just the symptoms.
1.  A senior developer can **self-reliantly deliver working software**.
1.  A senior developer understands that their job is to **provide solutions to problems**, not to write code.
1.  A senior developer **knows their tools**: IDE, OS, debugging, etc.
1.  A senior developer **knows how to choose a right tool and framework**.
1.  A senior developer actively employs the Boyscout principle and helps update this documentation ("always leave the campground cleaner than you found it")
1.  **Most importantly**, a senior developer reminds us all, or reminds a given individual developer, when we do not live up to what's written on this page, written in the [IDF Zen Code](/handbook/README.md#the-idf-zen-code), taught in the IDF Culture Course, or considered a best practice among senior developers. A senior developer is thus a "guarantor" that we continually optimize our team spirit, fun, productivity, learning, results, impact on the world, and programming practices.

### Senior backend developer

This list extends our expectations from a senior developer (see prev. section) for senior backend developers.

1.  Broad and extensive knowledge of the software development process and its technologies.
1.  Strong understanding of the primary programming language to use in IDF.
1.  Experience in design patterns.

### Senior frontend developer

This list extends our expectations from a senior developer (see prev. section) for senior frontend developers.

1.  Strong knowledge of HTML technologies and at least one modern JS framework and understand how it works.
1.  Middle-level knowledge of at least one different JS framework OR strong understanding of design patterns.

# Specific expectations for Video Calls

Since we work remotely, video calls are essential for us to communicate.
Here are what we expect from every IDF developer while on (video) calls:

1.  Always turn on video â€” unless the bandwidth suffers, at which point one or more people switch to audio-only.
1.  Be mindful of background noise in your end. If you are in a noisy place, that noise will get transmitted to everyone
    and will interrupt the team's concentration. In this case, you merely mute and unmute your microphone
    whenever you are speaking/not speaking.
1.  Make eye contact and be mentally 110% there so the developer who's talking can feel your presence
    and not feel like talking to a computer screen :-)
1.  Pay attention to other team members; they may ask for help, OR you may notice that they need help without directly asking.
    Especially the daily calls are a chance for all of us to be on the same page AND help others to save time & sanity so that we operate as efficiently as possible.
1.  Make sure you've read and re-read the guidelines on [Scrum Updates](/handbook/guides/scrum/scrumTeam.md) and [Scrum overview](handbook/guides/scrum/overview.md) so that you, for example, don't give lengthy updates on insignificant stuff ("..and then I corrected a typo on page XYZ..." :-) )
