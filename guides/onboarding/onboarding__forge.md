Create a Laravel Forge account
==============================

We use Laravel Forge in order to provision and deploy our applications.
You need to create an individual account later to be added by one of the
development team members to our development circle. Thus, you'll be able
to access to our servers and sites.

- Go to [https://forge.laravel.com/auth/register](https://forge.laravel.com/auth/register)
and register with your IDF email address. Don't fill out billing but simply click
on "Just Joining A Circle?".
- After you created the account, ask one of the development team members to add you
to our "Development Team" circle.
- Accept the circle invitation by going to [https://forge.laravel.com/circles](https://forge.laravel.com/circles).
- Then go to [https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/authentication](https://forge.laravel.com/user/profile#/authentication)
and follow instructions to enable Two Factor Authentication (2FA).
