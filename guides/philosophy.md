Philosophy of development process
=================================

Having the right mentality can do wonders for your work and life.
The following are things we consider very important at the IDF.

## Work smarter not harder
Automate your work, do not repeat yourself, have a plan, divide and conquer.

## Long-term planning and thinking
We are a product company, and that means we care about product quality:
We are to maintain, improve, and grow all of our products. **No compromise on quality**.


## The Boy Scout Rule
The Boy Scouts have a rule: **"Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it."**

It means that, even if it's not your job when encountered an issue, spaghetti, or alien code, 
you should always do your best to clean it up and fix everything that's wrong. 
It will make the work environment better and benefit everyone in the team. So, clean that stuff.


## Manage your own time
Other than our regular meetings, you can work anytime you feel more productive. 
Remote offices are fantastic, not only they offer flexibility in your schedule, 
they allow you to do actual work without the hassle and time-consuming activities of traditional offices. 
You will learn more about that in the IDF Company Culture course. 

## Why?
Always know WHY you do something, WHY we need something and try to understand WHY something is done in the way it is.  


## Chasing the perfect
It's all about the iteration:

And ship your code on stage 3 :)
