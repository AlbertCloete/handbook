# IxDF System

To accomplish our Mission and achieve our Vision efficiently, the IxDF relies on processes and tools.

The most widely-used is our OKR Process that helps us to work together and get things done within and across teams. The OKR Process is supported by our Product Process which is how we design and and deliver the future, and our Development Process which is how we build the future.
